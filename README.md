# Cplusplus-Program.

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

For this project I was presented with a scenario where, through collaboration with Airgead Banking, I was expected to develop an application that allowed users to see how their investment grow over time. When developing the application, I was expected to show the user a main menu. The different options would allow the user to enter the initial investment amount, the monthly deposit, the annual interest, and the number of years. Once the information was entered, the program would show the user results such as balance and interest with and without monthly deposits, the number of selected years, year end balance, and year end earned interest. 

#What did you do particularly well?

Something that I believe I did particularly well was to carefully leave comments for each new line that I created to make it easier for other developers to understand each step of the creation of the code. Another thing I believe I particularly did well was to create the calculations. Being something that I struggled the most, I was very proud of the results shown when running the program. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

After creating my code, something that I believe I could have done is a loop. For example, after the user enter the information and information is returned to the user, I believe there should have been an option to go back to the menu and enter new information. Creating this loop would allow for the user to either exit the program or go back and keep entering information until the user would be satisfied. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging piece of code I had to write was the part where the program had to do the right calculations in order to display the final result. The way in which I overcame this problem was by going back to my homework and using examples presented to me through activities or lab activities. For example, I would try to find parts in which they explained how to use certain commands. Once I had the right commands, I began adding them and modifying them as needed. Through this process, I was able to know where I was making mistakes and got to fix them right away. Finally, some of the tools that I am adding to my support network is clearly everything that I learned through the activities as well as the additional support resources given to me every week. All of these resources helped me understand the different commands used during the development of each program and I know they will help me in the future. 

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Before I took this class I was very much unaware of the programming language C++. The programming skills that I acquired throughout this course will surely help me complete other projects that I might have to develop in future classes as well as in the real world. 

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adding enough comments to allow for future developers to know what I added in each part of the program. If in the future another developer wants to make changes to the code, the comments should make it less challenging. A developer will be able to see what has been made in each part of the code and, through these comments, the developer would be able to make the necessary changes to erase or include more options to the program.
