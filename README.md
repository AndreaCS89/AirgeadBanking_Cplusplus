#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

For this project, I was tasked with addressing a specific scenario involving a collaborative effort with Airgead Banking. The objective was to design and develop an application that empowers users to track the growth of their investments over time. In the course of creating this application, the primary requirement was to furnish the user with a central menu. This menu was designed to offer various options, enabling the user to input pertinent financial data including the initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the investment horizon in years.

Once the user had inputted these crucial parameters, the program would generate and display a range of results. These results encompassed details such as the account balance, both with and without monthly deposits, for the selected number of years. Additionally, the application provided the year-end balance and the corresponding interest earned at the conclusion of each year.

#What did you do particularly well?

An aspect of my work that I executed with notable proficiency was the meticulous annotation of each newly added line of code. This practice was aimed at enhancing the comprehensibility of the codebase for fellow developers, thereby facilitating a smoother collaborative development process.

Furthermore, a noteworthy achievement that I take pride in is my aptitude for crafting intricate calculations. This was an area in which I initially encountered challenges, but through concerted effort and dedication, I was able to achieve highly satisfying results when running the program. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Upon completing the coding process, I reflected on a potential enhancement, which is the implementation of a loop structure. Specifically, I recognized an opportunity to incorporate a feedback loop in the application's user interface. This feature would permit users, after entering their information and receiving the desired results, to seamlessly return to the main menu and input fresh data. The introduction of such a loop would empower users to make multiple iterations, either exiting the program or revisiting the input stage, until they were fully satisfied with the outcomes. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most formidable coding challenge I encountered in this project pertained to the precise execution of calculations necessary for the display of the final results. To surmount this challenge, I resorted to a systematic approach, revisiting my foundational knowledge acquired through coursework, including examples from activities and lab exercises. I diligently sought out segments within these resources that elucidated the usage of specific commands, which I subsequently integrated into my codebase. My methodology entailed adapting and refining these commands as needed, a process that enabled me to identify and rectify errors promptly.

I also wish to emphasize the valuable role of my support network, encompassing the knowledge derived from various activities and the supplementary resources provided on a weekly basis. These resources played a pivotal role in enhancing my understanding of the diverse commands utilized in the development of each program. I am confident that these insights will continue to be invaluable assets in my ongoing journey.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Prior to enrolling in this course, I possessed limited familiarity with the programming language C++. The proficiency in programming that I have acquired during the course of this program undoubtedly equips me with the necessary skills to successfully undertake future projects in subsequent courses and within real-world contexts. These newly acquired skills will undoubtedly prove valuable assets in my academic and professional endeavors moving forward.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adding enough comments to allow for future developers to know what I added in each part of the program. If in the future another developer wants to make changes to the code, the comments should make it less challenging. A developer will be able to see what has been made in each part of the code and, through these comments, the developer would be able to make the necessary changes to erase or include more options to the program.
